# Sample
This document provides a walk-through for performing model-based testing of a ROS node from a RoboChart component.
It may be useful to first read through the documentation in [robotest-ros-gen](https://github.com/UoY-RoboStar/robotest-ros-gen).

## Requirements
* RoboTool installed from the releases of the [robotool repository](https://github.com/UoY-RoboStar/robotool/releases/).
* FDR4 installed from [https://cocotec.io/fdr/](https://cocotec.io/fdr/). For installation on modern distributions see the note in [](...)
* ROS Noetic, for running the tests.

## Creating a model

## Generating forbidden traces

## Tranforming traces for input to the ROS test generator

## Generating tests for ROS
